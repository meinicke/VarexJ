 * this is an artificial instruction that is automatically prepended to

 * of a new thread execution which does not cause CGs or is otherwise subject
 * to execution semantics that change the program state.
 * 
 * For instance, without it we would have to add a new ThreadInfo state to
 * determine if the first instruction within this thread was re-executed or
 * just happens to be the first transition we execute within this thread
